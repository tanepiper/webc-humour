    <h1>Visualising Sarcasam and Satire on the Web</h1>
    <p>
      We live in a connected world of words. Before the millenium, most people
      only spoke to people in their local area - and only heard from afar
      through the mass media of the day - mainly Television
    </p>
    <p>
      As more and more people came online through the 2000's - more an more
      mis-communication started to happen. The subtle parts of language,
      particularly English don't always translate well without face-to-face or
      voice communication
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 20 years ago, people were already asking for a &lt;sarcasam&gt; tag
      for the web.
    </p>
    <p>Well the wait it over! - Today it is here.</p>
    <h2>How sarcastic can we be?</h2>

    />
    <p>
      Well, adding more useless JavaScript to the web, burning up more of the
      planet with useless kilobytes -
      <web-sarcasam>and it's going to be great</web-sarcasam>.
    </p>
    <h2>But is it satire?</h2>

      alt="An model of a building on fire with the word SATIRE in bright green flashing on top of it"
    />
    <p>
      Philosophers for centuries will be pondering this very question I ask now?
    </p>
    <q>Can a web component be funny?</q>
    <p>This is <web-satire>total serious</web-satire></p>
