        We live in a connected world of words. Before the 20th Century, most
        people only spoke to other people within their local area, sometimes
        only their town or village. News travelled slow, and was filtered
        through a local lens. But come the 20th Century, mass media allowed for
        communication from afar culminating in mass media of the day -
        Television.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before the turn on the 21st Century, as more and more people came
        online through the 90's and 00's (Eternal September) - more an more
        mis-communication started to happen - and peoples' true views started to
        be expressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one of the biggest truisims I belive is that subtle parts of
        language, particularly English, don't always translate well without
        face-to-face or voice communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 20 years ago, people were already asking for a &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag
        for the web.
      </p>
      <p>Well the wait it over! - Today it is here.</p>

              Well, adding more useless JavaScript to the web, burning up more
              of the planet with useless kilobytes -
              <web-sarcasm>and it's going to be great</web-sarcasm>.
